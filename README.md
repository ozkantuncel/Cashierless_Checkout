My Object-Oriented Programming requested a project by me. I decided this project. I built Windows Form desktop application in C# and [MSSQL][11] . 

## Libraries Used
---
* [Architecture][2]: Windows Forms is a Graphical User Interface(GUI) class library which is bundled in .Net Framework. Its main purpose is to provide an easier interface to develop the applications for desktop, tablet, PCs. It is also termed as the WinForms

* [.NET][3]: .NET Core is a new version of .NET Framework, which is a free, open-source, general-purpose development platform maintained by Microsoft. It is a cross-platform framework that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.
* [Google.Cloud][4]: The Cloud Client Libraries are the recommended way to access Google Cloud APIs programmatically. The Cloud Client Libraries support accessing Google Cloud services in a way that significantly reduces the boilerplate code you have to write. 

* [AForge.NET][5]: an open source C# framework designed for developers and researchers in the fields of Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence - image processing, neural networks, genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic, machine learning, robotics, etc.instantly available when you return to your destination
* [System.Text.Json][7]: Provides high-performance and low-allocating types that serialize objects to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) text and deserialize JSON text to objects, with UTF-8 support built-in. 

* [ZXing.Net][8]: A library which supports decoding and generating of barcodes (like QR Code, PDF 417, EAN, UPC, Aztec, Data Matrix, Codabar) within images.
* [MessagingToolkit][9]: QRCode Library is a .NET component that can be used to encode and decode QRCode. QRCode is a 2 dimensional bar code that originated in Japan. 

* [Entity-Framework][10]: Entity Framework is an open-source ORM framework for .NET applications supported by Microsoft. It enables developers to work with data using objects of domain specific classes without focusing on the underlying database tables and columns where this data is stored.
